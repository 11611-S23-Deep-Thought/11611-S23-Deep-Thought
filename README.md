# Main repository for 11411: Natural Language Processing Final Project (QA/QG)

How to run and compile:
1. $ pip install -r requirements.txt
2. $ python setup.py
    - load all the models/tokenizers locally before running programs!
2. add "#!/usr/bin/env python3" to the top of scripts (answer.py and ask.py)
3. $ chmod +x answer.py ask.py
    - this makes both scripts executable
